Minimalistic mapping app using Skobbler's RealReach(TM) API

For use, include your own Skobbler API Key. Create a file called "apikey.js" like that:

`var YOUR_API_KEY = '9743a66f914cc249efca164485a19c5c';`

and put it in this repo's main directory. Then run it in your favourite webserver.

Notice that it won't currently work with HTTPS as browsers mark Skobbler's responses as insecure.
